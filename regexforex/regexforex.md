- You have been recently hired as a project consultant for the accounts department at Paypal to automate their manual processes. 
- Each morning their first task is to tally the overnight currency deposits reported from Paypal offices around the world.
- Due to a lack of reporting consistency, the deposits are in different formats.
- Using the sample data below, build a currency converter which will take in a batch of amounts in different formats, convert them into Australian dollars using today's exchange rate and return the total sum in AUD.

*Last nights deposits: 
$$22.0000
GBP44,000
AUD21k
EUR18500
THB10000000.000

** you can assign any exchange rate to the currencies.

***$$ = USD (The US office think their currency is pretty superior)
